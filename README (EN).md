# Brawl Stars Teams Creator

## Description
"Brawl Stars Teams Creator" is a program whose goal was to create teams of maximum 3 people to play together the old Club League of Brawl Stars. These were made taking into account certain aspects that optimized the creation of teams in which all the members could collaborate correctly and match their schedules.

**The program was used actively during several months by a group of club organizers proving very useful to automate tedious processes that were very time-consuming generating better results than the ones obtained manually. This group was in charge of a total of 3 clubs in the game, each of around 30 members.**

**IMPORTANT:** Because of privacy reasons, any references to the clubs managed using this code were eliminated along with the access to the spreadsheets used.

## What is Brawl Stars
Brawl Stars is an online multiplayer video game developed by Supercell whose beta version was launched in 2017. Since then, it has become one of the most popular videogames for mobile devices.

In Brawl Stars, the players can play different game modes and create the so called "clubs" that are groups of people who have a private chat to exchange messages and play together.

When this system was created, Brawl Stars counted with an event thought to promote collaboration between the different members of a club called "Club League". This event consisted on playing matches against people from other clubs to gain points according to the result. These points gained by all club members were summed up and the club with the most points won prizes. **Additionally, points earned for each match played with one or more teammates were doubled what made a lot of club leaders make teams so that their members would play together and earn more points.**

Brawl Stars counts with a public [API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/#/) that allowed the creation of this system.

## Purpose of the Project
This program was created due to the necessity of a group of club administrators of accelerating certain processes that used to be made manually. Specifically, **the creation of teams for the Club League was too tedious, repetitive and time-consuming for the ones in charge** so this system was created to make them automatically. Club Leagues happened once every 2 weeks so a program like this **greatly facilitated the job of this people**.

## System Functionality
The system developed counts with **3 main processes** necessary for their proper operation:

- **Data of the club members (Google Sheets):** The teams that were generated by this program aren't random. Instead, they are optimized according to certain requirements that will be explained below. To be able to operate with these requirements, certain data is required of the people that will be grouped. All of them form part of a Discord server in which they were asked to fill in a **Google Form** to obtain certain information about them necessary to make the teams. **The answers of this form were registered automatically in a Google spreadsheet, used as a database.**

- **Processing the data (Google Sheets API and Python):** Previous to the creation of the teams, it is necessary to extract and order the data from all the data stored in the database. To do so, it was decided to use another Google spreadsheet with one sheet for every club (3 in total). The program, developed in Python, used the **Google Sheets API** and the **Brawl Stars API** to extract all the entries that corresponded to a current member of one of the 3 clubs and add him to the new sheet, specifically to the one reserved for the club he is in. This way, ordered lists of each club's members and their data were obtained. All of this was done by the script "main.py" located in the directory "main".

- **Creation of the teams (Python):** The last step was the creation of the teams. Once they were completed, taking into account that they were going to be announced in a public channel of the Discord server, the program generated a generic message with the list of all the teams and their schedule and region to be sent directly by the administrators. This was done by the script "creador_equipos.py" in "team_managers".

It is important to remark that the program had **an update that added secondary functionalities of great interest like the possibility of creating predefined teams and the generation of statistics**. These statistics included the number of members in a club registered in the database and the number and names of those who weren't registered yet so that the administrators could contact them.

## Criteria Used for the Creation of the Teams
The teams that this program generated meet the following rules:

- In case 2 or more members of a club want to be together, they will be marked with an identifying tag in the database and **the program will always put them together**.

- The main criterion when creating a team is the place they live in which could be in one of the **3 regions** identified by Supercell: North America and Latin America, Southern Latin America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. **All the members of each team must be from the same region** to match schedules and optimize the game's performance during each match. The region of each person is one of the data asked for in the form.

- The second important criterion is **the time availability** which is divided into 3 possibilities: mornings, afternoons and nights. Members can choose in the form as many options as they want for when they can play with their teammates. The teams generated **are created optimizing the allignment of this choice among all the members of each team making sure there is at least one time of the day when they are all available**.

- As expected, the teams generated for each club **can only contain members of the same club** as people from different clubs can't play together in the event.
